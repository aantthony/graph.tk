## More About This Template

Hi, I'm [Zach](http://twitter.com/zacharyjohnson), and I made this for the internet.  I felt inspired by the "going dark" theme of the SOPA blackout protest.  I've been calling my representatives in Congress, but this gave me another outlet for my frustration with this legislation.
